    <title>Rules for Dibs on Australia</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>This game's goal is to either reach Australia, or circumnavigate Australia.<br>
        Your ship starts in a corner. You start off with 15 stores and you burn up one each turn.<br>
        If you run out of stores you lose and have to restart from the corner.<br>
        You can play by yourself, or with up to four players.<br>
    Each turn you move one hex.<br>
    Each turn you also draw a chance card using the buttons on the web site.<br>
    If you land on a blue hex you press 'Sea' and see a result.<br>
    If you land on a grey hex with lightning and swirls you press 'Storm'.<br>
    If you land on something that looks like an island, (apart from Australia and including Antarctica), press 'Island'.<br>
        Islands can also give you more stores, so if you are running low, go there.<br>
    If you land on a murky place with fish, press 'Reef'.<br>
        If you land on a boat, press 'Pirate' its usaly bad but there's chance of a jackpot.<br>

        P.S the counters are in a pouch in the box.<br>

        PP.S inside the box you will find 4 pieces with a numberline, and a pouch with the counters a British, a Dutch,<br>
        a French and Portuguese. And some store counters, these counters are used to keep track of your stores you need<br>
        move your stores counter to the amount of stores you have on the number line.<br>
