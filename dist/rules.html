    <title>Rules for Dibs on Australia</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>This game's goal is to either reach Australia, or circumnavigate Australia.
        Your ship starts in a corner. You start off with 15 stores and you burn up one each turn.
        If you run out of stores you lose and have to restart from the corner.
        You can play by yourself, or with four players.
    Each turn you move one hex.
    Each turn you also draw a chance card using the buttons on the web site.
    If you land on a blue hex you press 'Sea' and see a result.
    If you land on a grey hex with lightning and swirls you press 'Storm'.
    If you land on something that looks like an island, (apart from Australia and including Antarctica), press 'Island'.
        Islands can also give you more stores, so if you are running low, go there.
    If you land on a murky place with fish, press 'Reef'.
        If you land on a boat, press 'Pirate'.
